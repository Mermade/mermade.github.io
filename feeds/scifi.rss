Episode 1: Mullerby Fair

The first story in a new series featuring the immortal William Palmer. In an attempt to settle an age old dispute, Pilgrim must confront the ruthless Mr Speed, but he has a secret weapon.

Directed by Marc Beeby

A fourth series of four thrillingly dark adventures. Pilgrim, cursed with immortality by the King of the Greyfolk, is forever forced to walk between the human world and the world of Faerie in a never-ending quest to preserve the uneasy balance between the two. In this series, armed with the Abaeron, a book of incredibly powerful magic that protects its owner above all else, he can finally challenge Mr Speed who has stolen generations of brides from one family, separate devoted parents from their very strange new changeling baby, put a giant to sleep, and locate Merlin, the figure most feared in all the Faerie world. Hard tasks at the best of times, but Pilgrim must also contend with the relentless malice of the sorceress Mrs Pleasance and the devious cunning of the King of the Greyfolk himself.</description>

      <link>http://bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rcwkv</link>
      <description>Beneath the streets of London there is another London. A subterranean labyrinth of sewers and abandoned tube stations. A somewhere that is Neverwhere.

An act of kindness sees Richard Mayhew catapulted from his ordinary life into a subterranean world under the streets of London. Stopping to help an injured girl on a London street, Richard is thrust from his workaday existence into the strange world of London Below.

So begins a curious and mysterious adventure deep beneath the streets of London, a London of shadows where the tube cry of &apos;Mind the Gap&apos; takes on new meaning; for the inhabitants of this murky domain are those who have fallen through the gaps in society, the dispossessed, the homeless. Here Richard meets the Earl of Earl&apos;s Court, Old Bailey and Hammersmith, faces a life-threatening ordeal at the hands of the Black Friars, comes face to face with Great Beast of London, and encounters an Angel. Called Islington.

Joining the mysterious girl named Door and her companions, the Marquis de Carabas and the bodyguard, Hunter, Richard embarks on an extraordinary quest to escape from the clutches of the fiendish assassins Croup and Vandemar and to discover who ordered them to murder her family. All the while trying to work out how to get back to his old life in London Above.

A six part adaption of Neil Gaiman&apos;s novel adapted by Dirk Maggs, sees James McAvoy as Richard lead a stellar cast which includes Natalie Dormer, David Harewood, Sophie Okonedo, Benedict Cumberbatch, Christopher Lee, Anthony Head, David Schofield, Bernard Cribbins, Romola Garai, George Harris, Andrew Sachs, Lucy Cohu, Johnny Vegas, Paul Chequer, Don Gilet and Abdul Salis.</description>

      <title>Classic Serial : John Wyndham - The Chrysalids : Episode 1 - Episode 1</title>
      <link>http://bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l5qc7</link>
      <description>John Wyndham&apos;s post-apocalyptic science fiction classic dramatised by Jane Rogers.

Genetic mutation has devastated the world. In the emergent bleak, primitive society, any deviation is seen as the work of the devil, ruthlessly hunted out and destroyed. In law abiding, God-respecting Waknuk anyone who does not conform to the &apos;norm&apos; must keep their deviation secret or face the consequences of discovery.

Directed by Nadia Molinari


Written in 1955 Wyndham&apos;s novel explores the dangers inherent in discrimination and the threats posed by religious fundamentalism. The &apos;Old People&apos; who caused the apocalypse are depressingly like us: &apos; They were shut off by different languages and different beliefs. They created vast problems then buried their heads in the sands of idle faith.&apos; The children of the future (the Chrysalids) are able to &apos;think-together&apos; and so can rise above the selfish violence and conflicting religions of the past. Wyndham&apos;s story of a group of persecuted teenagers is more timely than ever in our post-Fukushima, war-riven, genetically engineered and religiously divided world. Jane Rogers is a playwright and novelist, her latest novel The Testament of Jessie Lamb won the Arthur C Clarke Award this year.</description>

Episode 1: Mullerby Fair

The first story in a new series featuring the immortal William Palmer. In an attempt to settle an age old dispute, Pilgrim must confront the ruthless Mr Speed, but he has a secret weapon.

Directed by Marc Beeby

A fourth series of four thrillingly dark adventures. Pilgrim, cursed with immortality by the King of the Greyfolk, is forever forced to walk between the human world and the world of Faerie in a never-ending quest to preserve the uneasy balance between the two. In this series, armed with the Abaeron, a book of incredibly powerful magic that protects its owner above all else, he can finally challenge Mr Speed who has stolen generations of brides from one family, separate devoted parents from their very strange new changeling baby, put a giant to sleep, and locate Merlin, the figure most feared in all the Faerie world. Hard tasks at the best of times, but Pilgrim must also contend with the relentless malice of the sorceress Mrs Pleasance and the devious cunning of the King of the Greyfolk himself.</description>

In 1185, William Palmer was making pilgrimage to Canterbury. Unbeknownst to him his fellow pilgrim was the King of the Greyfolk. When William claimed that the Church would wipe out the belief in the Faerie world, he was cursed by the Faerie King and condemned forever to the walk between our world and theirs.

The plays in PILGRIM are thrilling, dark and contemporary. They&apos;re set in a very recognisable, very real present, but a present haunted by the folktales of these islands: forest spirits, changeling children, Merlin...</description>

      <title>No Point Talking - 28/01/2016</title>
      <link>http://bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06yk7w1</link>
      <description>Award-winning sci-fi writer Geoff Ryman&apos;s new story for the BBC, imagining a future world where California has been split in two, each half with very different political outlooks.

His conservative hero finds himself in a place he doesn&apos;t like or understand, where everything he holds dear is challenged: relations between men and women, and even the very definitions of &apos;he&apos; and &apos;her&apos;.

This story was written as Geoff was investigating the portrayal of gender in utopian science fiction, as part of BBC Radio 4&apos;s Utopia season. That documentary which accompanies &apos;No Point Talking&apos; is called &apos;Herland&apos;.</description>

Here Richard meets the Earl of Earl&apos;s Court, Old Bailey and Hammersmith, faces a life-threatening ordeal at the hands of the Black Friars, comes face to face with Great Beast of London, and encounters an Angel. Called Islington.

Joining the mysterious girl named Door and her companions, the Marquis de Carabas and the bodyguard, Hunter, Richard embarks on an extraordinary quest to escape from the clutches of the fiendish assassins Croup and Vandemar and to discover who ordered them to murder her family. All the while trying to work out how to get back to his old life in London Above.
